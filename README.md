# 🖼️ AI Image Generator (DALL·E 3)

A simple web application built using **Flask** and **OpenAI’s DALL·E 3 model**. It generates AI images based on user-provided prompts.

## ✨ How It Works

- User enters a text prompt (e.g., "A cat astronaut in space").
- The app sends the prompt to OpenAI’s DALL·E 3 model.
- A unique AI-generated image is returned and displayed.
